    <h3>History Of Amazon</h3>
    <p>
        1994–2006: early years
        Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]

        <h3>Work At Amazon</h3>
    <p>
        The customer is at the heart of everything we do. Amazon is a place where smart, passionate people obsess over customers and innovate on their behalf. Amazon has created more U.S. jobs in the last decade than any other company. These are jobs that pay an average of $19 per hour, more than double the federal minimum wage. We also invest in employees’ success. Amazon will spend over $1.2 billion to provide free skills training to employees—helping them further their careers in tech and in-demand roles such as cloud computing.

    <h3>About Team</h3>
    <p>
        Teamwork happens when people work together toward a common goal. That goal could be professional or personal. You can work as a team to move a couch up a flight of stairs, launch a work project, or play soccer. Defining teamwork is simple, but understanding how to work well as a team can be complicated.
